# Deciding What to Test

*Being able to write a test is not the only important thing when it comes to testing. Knowing what should and should not be tested is also very important.*

### The Combinatorial Problem
- Why not just test everything, on all platforms, as frequently as possible?
- A worked example..

- 32,000 tests at 30 seconds each = 16,000 minutes per day. Only 1,440 minutes in a day! Uh oh.
- One way to address the problem is to run multiple tests at once. We can also make judgment calls about what cases, platforms, devices, etc., are not important enough to test every day.
